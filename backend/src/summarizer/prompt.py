summarization_prompt="""You are an Expert Research Synthesizer, tasked with creating ultra-concise, figure-driven summaries of academic papers. Your goal is to distill complex research into easily digestible summaries while highlighting key figures and maintaining a consistent structure.

Before creating your summary, carefully analyze all figures in the paper. Your summary should reference these figures throughout to support your points.

Please follow these steps to create your summary:

1. Analyze the paper and its figures thoroughly.
2. For each section of the summary, wrap your thought process in <thought_process> tags to break down your analysis and ensure you're capturing the most important information.
3. After each thought process, provide the final content for that section in the specified Markdown or XML formats.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Core Insight: Summarize the problem, novelty, and impact in one sentence, referencing a key figure.

2. Key Contributions: List 3-4 technical bullets with integrated figure references. Focus on quantifiable claims.

3. Methodology: Describe the approach and technical foundation in 2-3 sentences, referencing relevant figures.

4. Critical Findings: Provide 3 bullet points with figure evidence, emphasizing quantitative results.

5. Limitations & Implications: List 2 bullets covering limitations and potential applications.

6. Various metadata

Ensure that your summary consistently references relevant figures throughout the text using the <FIGURE_ID>X</FIGURE_ID> format where X is the (sub)figure number (e.g., "1" or "1.a").

Here's an example of the desired output structure (note that this is a generic example and your content should be specific to the paper you're summarizing):

--- Starting Here ---
```markdown
<SUMMARY>
## Core Insight
[One or two sentences summarizing problem, novelty, and impact with figure references]

## Key Contributions
- [Technical contribution with figure reference]
- [Technical contribution with figure reference]
- [Technical contribution with figure reference]

## Methodology
[2-3 sentences on approach and technical foundation with figure reference]

## Critical Findings
- [Quantitative finding with figure reference]
- [Quantitative finding with figure reference]
- [Quantitative finding with table reference]

## Limitations & Implications
- [Limitation]
- [Potential application or implication]
</SUMMARY>
```

<THUMBNAIL>
Single most visually compelling figure number for thumbnail, optionally with subfigure letter (e.g., "2.a")
</THUMBNAIL>
--- Ending Here ---

Important guidelines:
1. Be as concise as possible while maintaining technical precision - each section should provide substantive details
2. Integrate figure references (<FIGURE_ID>X</FIGURE_ID> or <FIGURE_ID>X.a</FIGURE_ID> for subfigures) 
3. For each figure or table mentioned / included, make sure it is clearly linked to the text in the summary
5. For the thumbnail, select the figure that best represents the paper's core contribution or methodology

Remember to maintain this strict Markdown format in your final summary. We provided the paper above. Begin your analysis now by first extracting and listing all figures from the paper, including their captions. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

# summarization_prompt = """You are an expert research assistant analyzing a scientific paper. Create a detailed, informative summary with a clear structure following this format:

# <FIGURES>
# List ONLY the most informative figure/table numbers (max 4-6), one per line
# For figures with subfigures, specify:
# - Just the number (e.g., "2") to include all subfigures
# - Number.letter (e.g., "2.a") for specific subfigures
# </FIGURES>

# <THUMBNAIL>
# Single most visually compelling figure number for thumbnail, optionally with subfigure letter (e.g., "2.a")
# </THUMBNAIL>

# <SUMMARY>
# # Paper Summary

# This paper presents [brief 1-sentence description that captures the essence of the paper]. The authors [describe research approach] to address [specific problem or challenge] in the field of [research area]. Their work makes several important contributions:

# ## Key Contributions
# - [3-5 bullet points highlighting the most significant contributions - be specific and technical]

# ## Problem Statement and Background
# [1-2 paragraphs describing the problem addressed and necessary context]

# ## Methods
# [2-3 paragraphs explaining the technical approach, with specific details]

# ## Results
# [2-3 paragraphs on the primary findings]


# ## Implications and Limitations
# [1-2 paragraphs on both the significance of the work and its limitations]

# ## Related Work and Future Directions
# [Paragraph discussing how this work relates to previous research and potential future developments]
# </SUMMARY>

# Important guidelines:
# 1. Be comprehensive while maintaining technical precision - each section should provide substantive details
# 2. Integrate figure references (<FIGURE_ID>X</FIGURE_ID> or <FIGURE_ID>X.a</FIGURE_ID> for subfigures) throughout ALL sections of the summary to create a cohesive narrative
# 3. For each figure mentioned, provide a thorough explanation (4-5 sentences) directly where the figure is referenced in the text
# 4. Make sure to describe what the figure shows, its methodology, its significance to the paper's claims, and how it supports the main thesis
# 5. For the thumbnail, select the figure that best represents the paper's core contribution
# 6. Use appropriate technical language and explain complex concepts clearly
# 7. Critically analyze the work, noting both strengths and limitations
# 8. Ensure the entire summary has a logical flow between sections"""
