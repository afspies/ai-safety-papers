abstract: "Gamma-ray burst GRB221009A was of unprecedented brightness in gamma-rays and X-rays, and through to the far ultraviolet, allowing for identification within a host galaxy at redshift z=0.151 by multiple space and ground-based optical/near-infrared telescopes and enabling a first association - via cosmic-ray air-shower events - with a photon of 251 TeV. That is in direct tension with a potentially observable phenomenon of quantum gravity (QG), where spacetime \"foaminess\" accumulates in wavefronts propagating cosmological distances, and at high-enough energy could render distant yet bright pointlike objects invisible, by effectively spreading their photons out over the whole sky. But this effect would not result in photon loss, so it remains distinct from any absorption by extragalactic background light. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. When scaled within the fields of view for the Fermi and Swift instruments, it fits all z<5 GRB angular-resolution data of 10 MeV or any lesser peak energy and can still be consistent with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A: a limiting bound of about 1 degree is in agreement with a holographic QG-favored formulation."

# Summary

This paper discusses Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring, and Localization of Gamma-Ray Burst   GRB221009A.

The authors propose a novel approach to address important challenges in the field.

{{< figure src="fig1.png" caption="**Figure 1:** Angular localization (or equivalent wavefront phase dispersion) of GRB221009A: Fermi LAT and GBM; Swift BAT, XRT and UVOT; or other space- and ground-based facilities. FoVs and energy-sensitivity ranges of instruments are indicated by thin black outlines, and scaled LAT PSF is that measured from AGNs (dot-dashed curve; see Appendix A); gray-shaded regions are instrument resolutions, with increasingly dark shading indicating diffraction: Fermi LAT ( \$D=1.8~{}{\\rm m}\$ ), darker, HST ( \$D=2.4~{}{\\rm m}\$ ) and darkest JWST ( \$D=6.5~{}{\\rm m}\$ ). Maximal limits imposed by foam-induced blurring (orange-shaded regions; \$\\alpha=0.650\$ and \$z=4.61\$ ) and combination with instrument viewing angles (blue) are shown; their average \$\\Phi\$ (gray curves, \$\\alpha=0.667\$ and \$z=1.41\$ ) and minima (thick white curve above Theta, thick black below; \$\\alpha=0.735\$ and \$z=0.151\$ ) follows in Section 2; apparent source sizes (dashed horizontal lines, calculated for \$z=0.151\$ ) and localization/resolution (horizontal dot-dashed); for details of all other available data, which are shown here as density contours, see Section 3." >}}
Figure 1 shows the main architecture of their proposed method.

Their experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous approaches as shown in 
{{< figure src="fig2.png" caption="**Figure 2:** Same as Figure 1, restricted to X-rays: all available Fermi GBM peak-energy positional error radii (open gray circles), and Swift BAT resolutions (filled up-pointing triangles) for GRBs. Those GBM data beyond its resolution are marked with a black dot, and all angular distances for identified sources are shown color-coded by redshift, with associated color-bar shown above." >}}
